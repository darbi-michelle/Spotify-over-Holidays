# Spotify-over-Holidays

Spotify streaming data from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day between the years of 2017 to 2020. 

In the graphs comparing streams over several years, streams per one million users is used in place of streams to normalise the data. This was calculated by dividing streams for each song by the number of total monthly active users (MAU) of Q4 for 2017-2019 and Q3 for 2020 as the Q4 MAU data is unavailable at the time of writing the code (01/21). The graph for Boxing Day only shows the top 5 songs as there is little to no trends in songs across the years unlike Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, where the top 10 songs are shown.
